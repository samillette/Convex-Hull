# CSC 212 Convex Hull Final Project

This project is the compilation of all things related to my group's work on our final project for our CSC 212 class. The class focused on data structures and abstrations.

# Convex-Hull
In order to better understand our project itself, its important to understand the mathematical concept behind our project, the **Convex Hull**.

Convex Hulls have many real life applications:
  - Collision avoidance
      - In video games
      - roomba/robotics
  - Tracking Disease Epidemic
  - Nuclear/Chemical Leak Evacuation
  - Basketball



# Graham Scan
Our task was to code the [Graham Scan Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Graham_scan&oldid=981736794) and create a visualization of the processed data.

# Quickhull
We chose to go a step further and do an additional algorithm for comparison with the Graham Scan Algorithm. The additional algorithm implemented was the [Quickhull Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Quickhull&oldid=986184164).

# About this code
This project's algorithms are written in c++ 2011, and the visualization tool is written in python 3.

# Instructions to produce a convex hull
Download this repository and navigate to the `Source Code` folder of this repository.

We utilized the benefits of a `Makefile` to run and compile our programs more efficiently than typing them in individually.
To use this you can type the following commands into the terminal:

 1. `make`
 2. `./output`
  
this compiles every `.cpp` file we used. Next comes the user input, you can either use a set of random pairs or a dataset with the location of every shot Kobe took in the NBA. If you chose the random pairs option,the program will now ask you to input the number of pairs
and a seed to produce a randomized set of pairs. The last input is to enter a `1` if you'd like to create a convex hull using the Graham Scan algorithm,
or a `2` if you'd like to do it using the quickhull algorithm.

After the input is entered and the file runs, it outputs either `grahamPairs.csv` or `quickhullPairs.csv` depending on which alogrithm you chose. These `.csv` contain the set of points in a way that can be interpreted by the visualization program.

To run this python program, you will need to have matplotlib installed. You should use the latest release of python. If you do not have matplotlib installed on your machine, you can find instructions [here](https://matplotlib.org/3.3.3/users/installing.html/ "Title"). If it is installed, enter `python3 visualization.py` and it will ask for the location of the `.csv` file to which you enter either `grahamPairs.csv` or `quickhullPairs.csv`, again, depending on what algorithm you chose before.
